# 🚢 Titanic Survival Prediction using Machine Learning

This project predicts whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster using machine learning classification techniques.

---

## 📌 Project Overview
The Titanic dataset is one of the most popular beginner-friendly datasets in data science.  
In this project, I built a model that predicts passenger survival based on features such as:

- Age  
- Gender  
- Passenger Class  
- Fare  
- Family Members

## 🚀 Key Steps in the Project
✅ Data Cleaning & Handling Missing Values  
✅ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
✅ Feature Engineering  
✅ Model Training & Testing  
✅ Performance Evaluation  
✅ Survival Prediction

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib / Seaborn  
- Scikit-learn  
- Jupyter Notebook  

---

## 📂 Project Files
- `Titanic Death Prediction.ipynb` → Main notebook with full workflow  
- `README.md` → Documentation  

---

## 📊 Output
The model predicts whether a passenger survived (`1`) or not (`0`) based on historical Titanic passenger data.

---

## ✨ Future Improvements
- Hyperparameter tuning  
- Trying advanced models (Random Forest, XGBoost)  
- Deploying the model using Streamlit
